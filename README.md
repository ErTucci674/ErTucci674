## About me ðŸ˜¬
My interests fall on Software and Game Development. Nonetheless, I am always up for new challenges in different disciplines.

My programming proficiency extends to C/C++ and Python for data control and management. Although, I have also worked on projects with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, the Python framework, Flask and SQL to create websites.

I recently became a GitHub user and I am currently working on sharing more projects.

## Currently Learning - Online Harvard Course ðŸ“–
I am currently taking an online course in Computer Science with Harvard University. The lectures include:
+ Command Line Interface: Linux, Window
+ Data Structure and Analysing: C/C++, Python, SQL
+ Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask
+ 2D Game Development: Lua, LÃ–VE
+ IDE: Visual Studio Code
+ Distributed Version Control System: Git, GitHub

## Currently working on - 2D Game ðŸ‘¾
The final project on my Computer Science Course involves designing my own digital product. My passion for videogames inspired me to the make a 2D game programmed in Lua with the framework LÃ–VE, _Invaders in Space_.
The design is based on the classic arcade game, _Space Invaders_. The main goal of this project is to learn how to independently _plan_, _design_ and _develop_ small contained games.
