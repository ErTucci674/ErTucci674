## About me ðŸ˜¬
I am naturally curious and eager to learn. I consider my dedication to be my 
greatest strength. I am a hard worker, always striving for excellence. While I enjoy 
working as part of an energetic and collaborative team, I am also highly self-motivated and confident at working independently.

I posses strong interpersonal skills including, patience and clear communication. I 
am fascinated by all things involving electro-technology and software, in particular 
coding languages - The heart of modern technology. For over five years, I have 
practiced Capoeira, a Brazilian Martial Art, which taught me discipline and improved 
my team work skills.

I was born in Italy, grew up in New Zealand and took further studies in England. 
During my journeys I developed an interest in different cultures and communities 
which sparked my interest in learning new languages and understanding the 
development of new technologies around the world. Having lived in multiple 
countries I have developed effective intercultural communication skills.

## My carreer path ðŸ‘£
In 2023, I graduated with a first-class honours in Electronic Engineering from University of the West of England. I have decided to persue a carreer in Software Development. During my degree, I developed a solid foundation in coding algorithms and data structure which have supported my transition to Software Development. To continue my learning, I have taken an online course with Harvard University and undertaken some self-directed online studies.

## Currently Learning - Online Harvard Course ðŸ“–
I am currently taking an online course in Computer Science with Harvard University. The lectures include:
+ Command Line Interface: Linux, Window
+ Data Structure and Analysing: C/C++, Python, SQL
+ Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask
+ 2D Game Development: Lua, LÃ–VE
+ IDE: Visual Studio Code
+ Distributed Version Control System: Git, GitHub

## Currently working on - 2D Game ðŸ‘¾
The final project on my Computer Science Course involves designing my own digital product. My passion for videogames inspired me to the make a 2D game programmed in Lua with the framework LÃ–VE, _Invaders in Space_.
The design is based on the classic arcade game, _Space Invaders_. The main goal of this project is to learn how to independently _plan_, _design_ and _develop_ small contained games.
