## About me ðŸ˜¬
My interests fall on Software and Game Development. Nonetheless, I am always up for new challenges in different disciplines.

My programming proficiency extends to C/C++ and Python for data control and management, and Lua/LÃ–VE for game developing. Although, I have also worked on projects with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, the Python framework, Flask and SQL to create websites.

I recently became a GitHub user and I am currently working on sharing more projects.
