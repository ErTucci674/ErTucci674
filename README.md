## About me ðŸ˜¬
I am naturally curious and eager to learn. I consider my dedication to be my 
greatest strength. I am a hard worker, always striving for excellence. While I enjoy 
working as part of an energetic and collaborative team, I am also highly self-motivated and confident at working independently.

I posses strong interpersonal skills including, patience and clear communication. I 
am fascinated by all things involving electro-technology and software, in particular 
coding languages - The heart of modern technology. For over five years, I have 
practiced Capoeira, a Brazilian Martial Art, which taught me discipline and improved 
my team work skills.

I was born in Italy, grew up in New Zealand and took further studies in England. 
During my journeys I developed an interest in different cultures and communities 
which sparked my interest in learning new languages and understanding the 
development of new technologies around the world. Having lived in multiple 
countries I have developed effective intercultural communication skills.

## My carreer path ðŸ‘£
In 2023, I graduated Electronic Engineering. During my degree, I developed a solid foundation in coding algorithms and data structure which lead to a change in my career path towards Software Development. Hence, I took an online course with Harvard University and carried on some self-studies online on the topic.

## Currently Learning - Online Harvard Course ðŸ“–
I am currently taking an online course in Computer Science with Harvard University. The lectures include:
+ Command Line Interface: Linux, Window
+ Data Structure and Analysing: C/C++, Python, SQL
+ Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask
+ 2D Game Development: Lua, LÃ–VE
+ IDE: Visual Studio Code
+ Distributed Version Control System: Git, GitHub

## Currently working on - 2D Game ðŸ‘¾
The last part of my Computer Science Course revolves around designing my own digital product. My passion and for videogames lead me into the making of a 2D game programmed in Lua with the framework LÃ–VE, _Invaders in Space_.
The product is based on the classic arcade game, _Space Invaders_. The main goal of this project is to learn how to _plan_, _design_ and _develop_ small contained games on my own.
